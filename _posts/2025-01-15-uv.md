# What is uv
If you are following the recent developments in the python ecosystem, theres one new tool
that stands out by far and might change the way you work with python.
I am talking about [uv], a super fast all-in-one python project management tool to
replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

# Background Info
[uv] is developed by [astral], a venture-backed company, which has dedicated its mission to 
deliver `Next Gen Python Tooling`.
Another well known tool made by astral is [ruff], a super fast python linter and formatter written in rust.


It was initially just a faster [pip] replacement, but also with [rye] (Armin Ronachers solo project as) making
an occurence in the python tooling space, it quickly surpassed rye to become the go to tool for python 

# Some Numbers
Based on a [talk][talk_eurorust] Charlie Marsh (Founder of Astral) gave at `Euro Rust 2024` in October,
**13.3%** of all packages downloaded from PyPi are downloaded with uv. In absolute numbers that are
around a quarter billion downloads according to his talk.
uv itself also is downloaded **~28.1M/month** and also its github star history shows a huge growth.

It recently even surpassed their other well established tol [ruff].
