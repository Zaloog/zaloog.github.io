# What is uv
If you are following the recent developments in the python ecosystem, theres one new tool
that stands out by far and might change the way you work with python.
I am talking about [uv], a super fast all-in-one python project management tool to
replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

# Background Info
[uv] is an open source tool developed by [astral], a venture-backed company, which has dedicated its mission to 
deliver "Next Gen Python Tooling".
Another well known tool made by astral is [ruff], a super fast python linter and formatter written in rust.

After Armin Ronacher started [rye] as a "cargo for python" to unify the fragmented python tooling
landscape and some common ideas of Armin and Charlie Marsh (the founder of [astral])
regarding what the python tooling landscape should look like, astral took stewardship of [rye] with
the release of [uv] in February 2024. More infos can be found on [Armins][rye_uv_post_armin]
and [astral Blog][rye_uv_blog_astral].


# Some Numbers
According to a [talk][talk_eurorust] Charlie Marsh gave at Euro Rust 2024 in October,
**13.3%** of all packages downloaded from PyPi are downloaded with [uv] at that time. In absolute numbers that are
around a quarter billion downloads.
[uv] itself is downloaded **~28.1M/month** and also its github star
history shows a steady growth since its realease.

[uv] recently even surpassed astrals other well established tool [ruff].
