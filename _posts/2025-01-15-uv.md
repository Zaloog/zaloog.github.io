# What is uv
If you are following the recent developments in the python ecosystem, theres one new tool
that stands out by far and might change the way you work with python.
I am talking about [uv], a super fast all-in-one python project management tool to
replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

# Background Info
[uv] is an open source tool developed by [astral], a venture-backed company, which has dedicated its mission to 
deliver "Next Gen Python Tooling".
Another well known tool made by astral is [ruff], a super fast python linter and formatter written in rust.

After [Armin Ronacher][Armin] started [rye] as a "cargo for python" to unify the fragmented python tooling
landscape and some common ideas of Armin and [Charlie Marsh][Charlie] (the founder of [astral])
regarding what the python tooling landscape should look like, astral took stewardship of [rye] with
the release of [uv] in February 2024. More infos can be found on [Armins][blog_post_rye_uv_armin]
and [astral Blog][blog_post_rye_uv_astral].


# Some Numbers
According to a [talk][talk_eurorust] Charlie Marsh gave at Euro Rust 2024 in October,
**13.3%** of all packages downloaded from PyPi were downloaded with [uv] at that time. In absolute numbers that are
around a quarter billion downloads.
[uv] itself is downloaded **~28.1M/month** and also its github star
history shows a steady growth since its realease and currently counts over **36.1k** stars.

[uv]'s star count recently even surpassed astrals other well established tool [ruff] (**34.6k** stars).

# Basic Features
## Python version management
[uv] manages python runtimes for you. These python versions are downloaded from the
[python-build-standalone][python_build_standalone] repository,
which came under the stewardship of [astral] in December 2024
(for more infos check this [blog post][blog_post_python_standalone_astral]).
You can list your installed version with `uv python list` and can install new
versions e.g. *python 3.13.1* with `uv python install 3.13.1`.

On a project level [uv] creates a *.python-version* file which defines the python version
[uv] uses for your current project. You can update that file with `uv python pin <VERSION>`.

## Python project management
A new project can be initialized with `uv init <PROJECT_NAME>`. This creates a basic skeleton
and can be extended and customized with various flags. 
With `uv add <DEPENDENCY>` [uv] adds the latest dependency to the *pyproject.toml* and
installs all dependencies in a newly created virtual environment *.venv*-folder located at the root of your project.

[uv] also supports dependency groups (see also [PEP735]), this allows to add dependencies for
development like [pytest] to be added into your *dev* dependency
group with `uv add --group dev pytest`.
To synchronize the virtualenv with the declared dependencies `uv sync` can be used.
