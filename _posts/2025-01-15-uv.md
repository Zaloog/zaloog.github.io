# What is uv
If you are following the recent developments in the python ecosystem, there is one new tool
that stands out by far and might change the way you work with python.
I am talking about [uv], a super fast all-in-one python project management tool to
replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

# Background
[uv] is an open source tool developed by [astral], a venture-backed company, which has dedicated its mission to 
deliver "Next Gen Python Tooling".
Another well known tool made by astral is [ruff], a super fast python linter and formatter written in rust.

Initially [Armin Ronacher][Armin] started [rye] as a "cargo for python" to unify the fragmented python tooling
landscape (for a great overview check out this [talk][talk_anna_lena] by Anna-Lena Popkes).
Due to common ideas of Armin and [Charlie Marsh][Charlie] (the founder of [astral])
regarding what the python tooling landscape should look like, astral took stewardship of [rye] with
the release of [uv] in February 2024. With the plan that [uv] will become that unified successor project.

More information can be found in these blog posts from [Armins blog][blog_post_rye_uv_armin]
and [astrals blog][blog_post_rye_uv_astral].


# Numbers
According to a [talk][talk_eurorust] Charlie Marsh gave at Euro Rust 2024 in October,
**13.3%** of all packages downloaded from PyPi were downloaded with [uv] at that time. In absolute numbers that are
around a quarter billion downloads.
[uv] itself is downloaded **~28.1M/month** and also its github star
history shows a steady growth since its release and currently counts over **36.1k** stars.

[uv]'s star count recently even surpassed astrals other well established tool [ruff] (**34.6k** stars).


# Installation
There are many ways to install [uv],
on Linux/Mac the standalone installer can be installed with:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
and on Windows using powershell with:
```pwsh
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

I prefer using a system package manager like [scoop] for Windows:
```bash
scoop install main/uv
```
or [homebrew] for Mac:
```bash
brew install uv
```
For a complete list of all installation ways you can check the [docs][uv_install].

# Features
## Python version management
[uv] manages python runtimes for you. These python versions are downloaded from the
[python-build-standalone][python_build_standalone] repository,
which came under the stewardship of [astral] in December 2024
(for more information check this [blog post][blog_post_python_standalone_astral]).
You can list your installed version with `uv python list` and can install new
versions e.g. *python 3.13.1* with `uv python install 3.13.1`.

On a project level [uv] creates a *.python-version* file which defines the python version
[uv] uses for your current project. You can update that file with `uv python pin <VERSION>`.

## Python project management
A new project can be initialized with `uv init <PROJECT_NAME>`. This creates a basic skeleton
and can be extended and customized with various flags. 
With `uv add <DEPENDENCY>` [uv] adds the latest dependency to the *pyproject.toml* and
installs all dependencies in a newly created virtual environment *.venv*-folder located at the root of your project.

[uv] also supports dependency groups (see also [PEP735]), this allows to add dependencies for
development like [pytest] to be added into your *dev* dependency
group with `uv add --group dev pytest`.
To synchronize the virtualenv with the declared dependencies `uv sync` can be used.


## Tool management and uvx
When installing python cli-tools, [pipx] was the way to go to install those in an isolated environment.
[uv] also supports managing such kind of tools. To install a new tool you can use `uv tool install <PACKAGE>`.
A list of all installed tools can be displayed with `uv tool list`.

Another nice feature of [uv] is *uvx*, for example `uvx ruff`, this is basically a shortcut for `uv tool run ruff`
and installs and executes [ruff] in a temporary isolated environment.
Since [uv] caches installed packages in a global cache, the subsequent invocation of `uvx ruff` is basically instant.

This also makes spinning up a python REPL with a certain package installed a single command `uvx --from <PACKAGE> python`.
Let's say you are developing a new application and are still working on the feature branch
in your git repository and want to show your colleague the current state, *uvx* got you covered.
With `uvx git+<GIT_REPO_LINK>@<BRANCH>` you can directly run the application from the specified branch,
alternatively you can even provide a tag or commit-hash.

# What are uv aiting for
I can highly recommend trying out [uv] for your next project or transitioning your existing projects
to [uv] to profit from the speed advantages [uv] provides.

[astral] also has extensive [documentation][docs_integration_astral] on how to integrate [uv] with popular tools like
docker, github-actions, jupyter, AWS Lambda and more, which makes adopting [uv] a breeze.

But... One thing to keep in mind is, that [astral] is a venture-backed company and needs to generate revenue at some point.
At the moment [uv] and [ruff] are free and open source under MIT License.
The current plan to generate revenue appears to involve [astral] monetizing additional services build on top of their already available tools,
rather than making a license change at some point (Charlie responds to a audience question [here][talk_pycon_us_plan]).

The open-source community has seen license changes before, as with the
IaC tool terraform by hashicorp ([announcement][terraform_license_change]).
This led to the creation of [opentofu] as an open source fork of terraform.

One of the next tools coming from [astral] might be "red-knot",
a type-checker that will be integrated into [ruff] and I am curious, what other tools [astral] will
build for the python ecosystem.

With that, now is the perfect time to explore [uv] and experience its benefits for yourself.
Whether you are looking for speed, flexibility, or seamless integration, [uv] delivers.
