# What is this post about
In this post, I’ll dive into a powerful feature of [uv]: the `--with` option.
I’ll explain how it works, share practical examples, and show how it solved a key challenge in my latest tool, [ayu].
But first of all...

# How is uv doing
Since my last [post][last_post] about [uv], almost half a year has passed and the all-in-one python version, package, project and tool manager
by [astral] has has become a staple in many Python developers’ workflows..

The uv GitHub [repo][uv_gh] has surpassed 60,000 stars, and the latest **0.7.19** release ([Release Notes][uv_latest])
introduces [uv]'s own stable [build backend][uv_build_backend_docs].
In a future release, this will replace [hatchling] as the default build backend when initializing projects with `uv init`.
# The `--with` option 
## About
When running a Python script that depends on external packages, those packages must be installed in the script’s environment.
The recommended approach is to declare dependencies explicitly, either in a project’s `pyproject.toml` or
using inline script metadata as defined in [PEP 723][pep723]. Here’s an [example][pep723_example]:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

Lets say you put the above example in a `script.py` file. When you remove the inline script metadata at the beginning, you will
be faced with the following error message when running `uv run script.py`.

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

This was to be expected, because we did not install the `requests` or `rich` dependencies to run the script.
[uv] supports installing those required dependencies also when invoking the script, if you do not declare them in the metadata part.
This is where the `--with` option comes into play.

## Usage
If you run the `script.py` file now with the following command instead:
```bash
uv run --with requests,rich script.py
```
You will see that [uv] installs both dependencies on the fly for the invocation of that script.
And since [uv] caches those, consecutive invocations run almost instantly.

## What else to do with `--with`
If you want to start a python REPL with some dependencies in your current project runtime to test something
you can easily do so for example with:

```bash
uv run --with pandas python
```
When executing this, `pandas` will not be added to your project environment, as stated in the docs.
>When used in a project, these dependencies will be layered on top of the project environment in a separate, ephemeral environment.
These dependencies are allowed to conflict with those specified by the project.


Another use case might be if you want to start a jupyter server with access to your projects environment, you can do that with:
```bash
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```

For a more detailed descriptions on how to work with [uv] and jupyter take a look in the [docs section][uv_jupyter].


# The problem it solved for me
The last months I have been working on [ayu], which is a command-line tool to make [pytest] more interactive
and currently looks like this:
![ayu_image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zaloog/ayu/main/images/main_screen.png)
*The [ayu] TUI displaying a test tree built from pytest data.*

It is a TUI written with [textual], which starts a websocket server in the background to collect data from pytest.
To get the data from pytest to the websocket server, [ayu] is at the same time a pytest plugin and utilizes pytest-hooks to
send different data based on pytest hooks invoked.

For example the test tree you see in the above picture is built by invoking [pytest] with `--collect-only` when the app is started.

My challenge was ensuring [ayu] remained independent of the project’s environment while functioning as a pytest plugin.
I wanted users to run it directly (e.g., `uvx ayu` or `uv tool install ayu`) without needing to install it in their project.
However, as a pytest plugin, [ayu] must be in the project’s environment to send data to the websocket server.

This is where the `--with` option from [uv] comes to rescue.
I am now able to execute pytest commands from the application, which would use your projects environment, but also install [ayu]
itself on the fly to send the data from pytest to the TUI via the websocket.
That means, in the background [ayu] is executing for example

```bash
uv run --with ayu pytest --collect-only
```

to get the test tree and (after some processing) send it to the TUI.
When executing tests the following command is invoked:

```bash
uv run --with ayu pytest
```
This runs your normal test suite and gives live updates by showing an icon behind the test node.

Some other features of [ayu] are also to be able to quickly mark tests and run a specific subset of your test suite.
With the latest release, I added a filewatcher using [watchfiles], which (if toggled) automatically re-runs all tests in a single
file, if the file is updated.


Building [ayu] the way I wanted it to be, would have not been possible without the amazing features [uv] provides.

Thanks to [uv] python developers can now do things which were not possible before and I am exited to see, how [astral]
is continueing to improve the developer experience of many Pythonistas.
