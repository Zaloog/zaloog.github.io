# What is this post about
In this post I will explore one specific feature of [uv], namely the `--with` option, how it is used and
also how it helped me solve a problem for the latest tool I developed.
But first of all...

# How is uv doing
Since my last [post][last_post] about [uv], almost half a year has passed and the all-in-one python version, package, project and tool manager
by [astral] has it's place in many python developer workflows by now.

The uv github [repo][uv_gh] already broke the 60.000 stars
mark and with the latest **0.7.19** release ([Release Notes][uv_latest]), [uv] now also provides its own stable [build backend][uv_build_backend_docs],
which in a future release will replace [hatchling] as the current default build backend, when starting a new project with `uv init`.
 
# The `--with` option 
## About
In general, when you run a python script, which requires other packages they must be installed in the environment, the script runs in.
The recommended way to do that is to explicitly declare the dependencies, by either using a project or inline script metadata as defined
in [PEP 723][pep723] like in this [example][pep723_example]:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "requests<3",
#   "rich",
# ]
# ///

import requests
from rich.pretty import pprint

resp = requests.get("https://peps.python.org/api/peps.json")
data = resp.json()
pprint([(k, v["title"]) for k, v in data.items()][:10])
```

Lets say you put the above example in a `script.py` file. When you remove the inline script metadata at the beginning, you will
be faced with the following error message when running `uv run script.py`.

```bash
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'requests'
```

This was to be expected, because we did not install the `requests` or `rich` dependencies to run the script.
[uv] supports to get those required dependencies also when invoking the script, if you do not declare them in the metadata part.
This is where the `--with`-option comes into play.

## Usage
If you run the `script.py` file now with the following command instead:
```bash
uv run --with requests,rich script.py
```
You will see that [uv] installs both dependencies on the fly for the invocation of that script.
And since [uv] caches those, consecutive invocations run almost instantly.

## What else to do with `--with`
If you want to start a python REPL with some dependencies in your current project runtime to test something
you can easily do so for example with:

```bash
uv run --with pandas python
```
When executing this, `pandas` will not be added to your project environment, as stated in the docs.
>When used in a project, these dependencies will be layered on top of the project environment in a separate, ephemeral environment.
These dependencies are allowed to conflict with those specified by the project.


Another use case might be if you want to start a jupyter server with access to your projects virtual environment, you can do that with:
```bash
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```

For a more detailed descriptions on how to work with [uv] and jupyter take a look in the [docs section][uv_jupyter].


# The problem it solved for me
The last months I have been working on [ayu], which is a commandline tool to make [pytest] more interactive
and currently looks like this:
![ayu_image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zaloog/ayu/main/images/main_screen.png)

It is a TUI written with [textual], which starts a websocket server in the background to collect data from pytest.
To get the data from pytest to the websocket server, [ayu] is at the same time a pytest plugin and utilizes pytest-hooks to
send different data based on the hooks invoked.

For example the test tree you see in the above picture is build by invoking [pytest] with `--collect-only` when the app is started.

The problem I had was, that I wanted the tool to be independent of the project environment it is used in.
It should just act as a tool you can use directly with e.g. `uvx ayu` or after installing it as a tool with uv via `uv tool install ayu`.
But at the same time it also requires to be installed in your project environment to act as the pytest plugin, otherwise no data could
be send to the websocket server.

This is where the `--with` option from [uv] comes to rescue.
I am now able to execute pytest commands from the application, which would use your projects environment, but also install [ayu]
itself on the fly to send the data from pytest to the TUI via the websocket.
That means, in the background [ayu] is executing for example

```bash
uv run --with ayu pytest --collect-only
```

to get the test tree and (after some processing) send it to the TUI.
When executing tests the following command is invoked:

```bash
uv run --with ayu pytest
```
This runs your normal test suite and gives live updates by showing an icon behind the test node.

Some other features of [ayu] are also to be able to quickly mark tests and just run a specific subset of your test suite.
With the latest release, I added a filewatcher using [watchfiles], which (if toggled) automatically re-runs all tests in a single
file, if the file is updated.
